## A message from David

Hi SSF2 modding community, it's me. Some of you may know who I am, others may be new! That's fine.
I just wanted to say that, despite all the rough times, I still appreciate the time I spent, people I met, and things I learned during my time in the community. I couldn't have ever started making these IDKs without y'all in the first place.

I don't believe I'll ever be coming back to the modding community itself, but as you can see, I don't mind lending a hand every now and then. It's the least I could do to pay you guys back. Hope you enjoy the new update! Looks like there's a bunch of cool things both inside and out.

# Super Smash Flash 2 Independent Development Kit [v1.3.1.1]

### What is this?
This is the 1.3.1.1 version of the SSF2 IDK, which is a reverse-engineer/decompilation of SSF2, meaning the entire game can be rebuilt from source with any changes you make, only limited by your imagination and ability to work with the game engine.

The "build" folder is the regular, playable game, compiled from the the "src" folder which contains source files meant to be manipulated and compiled with Adobe Animate.

### How do I use it?

Your best course of action would be to [clone the repo using GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) (GHD can be downloaded [here](https://desktop.github.com).) Doing this allows you to easily track any changes you make as well as get updates from the repo on Github.com whenever available.

If you're not familiar with Animate and are looking to learn it for the sake of modding SSF2 or maximizing benefit from this repo, consider my Adobe Animate [Discord server](https://discord.gg/enPB5tt).
